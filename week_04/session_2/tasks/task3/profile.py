# Week 4, Session 2: Task 3

# Given an incomplete function student_profile that takes a student's first name and
# last name as mandatory arguments, and accepts additional arbitrary number
# of keyword arguments like age, grade, and any other optional information
# (e.g., hobbies, GPA, etc.). The function should return a dictionary
# containing all the information.

# Your task is to complete the function


def student_profile(firstname, lastname, kwargs):   # change here
    # complete your code here

    return profile


# Once completed, make at least two function calls to print the returned
# dictionary, one with only the mandatory arguments and another one with
# a few more keyword arguments such as faculty, programme, country, etc...
