# Python File Operations & Data Processing Tutorial

This tutorial covers fundamental Python programming concepts through practical file operations and data processing exercises.

## Task Difficulty Order

### Beginner Level

**1. word_counter.py** - Count words in a text file
- Basic file reading and string processing

**2. user_info.py** - Collect and save user information to a file  
- Simple file writing with user input

### Intermediate Level  

**3. freq_analysis.py** - Analyze letter frequency in text files
- Dictionary usage for counting and text analysis

**4. sales_data.py** - Analyze CSV sales data for insights
- Reading CSV files, mathematical operations, and finding patterns

**5. log_data.py** - Extract failed login attempts from server logs
- CSV filtering, string matching, and data extraction

**6. shopping_list.py** - Interactive shopping list with file persistence
- Functions, loops, menus, and file operations

**7. exam_maker.py** - Create and save quiz questions to files
- Complex data structures, file formatting, and user interaction

### Advanced Level

**8. average_grade.py** - Calculate and rank student grades from CSV
- Data processing, sorting algorithms, and report generation

## Activity Structure

### Task 1 (File Processing Basics)
Located in `/task1/` - Focus on reading files and basic data manipulation

### Task 2 (User Interaction & File Operations)  
Located in `/task2/` - Emphasis on user input, functions, and file writing

### Task 3 (Large Dataset Projects)
Located in `/task3/` - Work with substantial CSV datasets for real-world applications:
- **Library Management System** - Book database operations
- **Music Data Analysis** - Chart analysis and music quiz creation  
- **Pokemon Statistics** - Data analysis and battle simulations

## Key Concepts Covered

- File I/O operations (reading and writing)
- CSV data processing
- Error handling with try/except
- Dictionary operations and data structures
- String manipulation and cleaning
- User input validation
- Function definitions and organization
- Loops and conditional logic
- Data sorting and filtering
- Report generation and formatting

## Getting Started

1. Begin with the **Beginner Level** tasks to build fundamental skills
2. Work through each task in the suggested order
3. Use the provided data files for testing (`.txt`, `.csv`, `.log`)
4. Each task includes detailed comments and hints
5. Focus on understanding concepts rather than just completing tasks

## Data Files Included

- `student_data.csv` - Sample student grades
- `sales.csv` - Sales transaction data  
- `site.log` - Web server log data
- `story.txt`, `story2.txt`, `glasses.txt` - Text files for word counting
- Large datasets in `/task3/` subdirectories

## Recipes for Success

- Read the task comments carefully - they contain important hints
- Test your code with the provided data files  
- Don't worry about perfect solutions - focus on learning
- Experiment with different approaches
- Ask for help if you get stuck on concepts
