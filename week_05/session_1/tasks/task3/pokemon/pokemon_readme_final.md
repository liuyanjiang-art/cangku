## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Foundation (45-60 minutes)
**Must Complete First:**
- Load CSV file with error handling
- Convert numeric columns to integers properly
- Handle Type 2 empty values appropriately
- Convert Legendary text to boolean values
- Display sample data to verify loading

### Phase 2: Core Features (90-120 minutes)
**Choose Based on Your Path:**
- Implement 2-3 main functions for your chosen approach
- Focus on getting basic functionality working
- Test with known Pokemon data (Pikachu, Charizard)

### Phase 3: User Interface (60-90 minutes)
**All Paths Need:**
- Menu system for user interaction
- Clear prompts and error messages
- Formatted output for readability
- Input validation and error handling

### Phase 4: Polish and Extensions (30-60 minutes)
**Optional Enhancements:**
- Additional features specific to your path
- Improved error handling
- Enhanced user experience
- Performance optimisations

## Data Conversion Examples

### Critical Data Processing
```python
# Convert numeric stats
hp = int(row[5])           # HP
attack = int(row[6])       # Attack
total = int(row[4])        # Total stats

# Handle optional Type 2
type2 = row[3] if row[3].strip() else None

# Convert Legendary status
is_legendary = row[12].lower() == 'true'

# Ensure complete data
if len(row) < 13:
    continue  # Skip incomplete rows
```

## Common Implementation Challenges

### Challenge: Type effectiveness calculations
**Complexity:** High - requires type chart data
**Solution:** Start with simple stat comparisons, add type effectiveness later
**Alternative:** Focus on other features first

### Challenge: Balanced team building
**Complexity:** High - requires optimisation logic
**Solution:** Try simple heuristics (type diversity, stat thresholds)
**Alternative:** Manual team validation instead of automatic generation

### Challenge: Complex battle simulation
**Complexity:** Medium-High - requires game knowledge
**Solution:** Use simplified battle logic (total stats, type advantages)
**Alternative:** Rock-paper-scissors style comparison

### Challenge: Question generation variety
**Complexity:** Medium - requires creative programming
**Solution:** Template-based questions with data substitution
**Alternative:** Fixed question pool with random Pokemon selection

## Testing Strategy

### Data Verification
- Load dataset and check total count (should be 800)
- Verify specific Pokemon (Pikachu #25, Charizard #6)
- Confirm stat totals match expectations
- Test type filtering with known results

### Feature Testing
- Test search with partial names and exact matches
- Verify mathematical calculations with known values
- Test edge cases (single-type Pokemon, highest/lowest stats)
- Confirm user input validation works

### Performance Testing
- Time critical operations (should be under 1 second)
- Test with various input types and sizes
- Verify memory usage remains reasonable

## Pair Programming Approach

### Effective Role Distribution
**Driver Focus Areas:**
- Implementing specific calculations
- Handling user input and menu systems
- Writing file I/O operations
- Debugging syntax and logic errors

**Navigator Focus Areas:**
- Planning overall program structure
- Suggesting algorithmic improvements
- Watching for edge cases and error conditions
- Keeping track of feature completeness

### Natural Switch Points
- After completing data loading function
- Between different feature implementations
- When transitioning from core logic to user interface
- After implementing each major calculation or game component

## Time Allocation Guidance
