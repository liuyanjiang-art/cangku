# Pair Programming Guide for Activity 3

## What is Pair Programming?

Pair programming involves two people working together on the same code at the same time:
- **Driver**: Person actively typing and writing code
- **Navigator**: Person reviewing, suggesting, and thinking ahead

## Benefits for Learning

- **Immediate feedback**: Catch errors and misconceptions quickly
- **Knowledge sharing**: Learn different approaches and techniques
- **Reduced frustration**: Two minds tackling complex problems
- **Better code quality**: Continuous review leads to cleaner solutions

## How to Structure Your Session

### 1. Initial Planning (15-20 minutes)
- Read the task requirements together
- Discuss which project to tackle (library, music, or Pokemon)
- Decide on overall approach and data structures
- Sketch out main functions needed

### 2. Setup and Roles
- One person shares screen or you work on one computer
- Start with one person as driver, switch every 20-30 minutes
- Navigator should not just watch - actively participate

### 3. Work Phases

**Phase 1: Data Loading (30-45 minutes)**
- Focus on getting file reading working
- Test with small data samples first
- Debug file path and format issues together

**Phase 2: Core Functionality (60-90 minutes)**
- Implement basic search/display features
- Take turns driving for different functions
- Navigator reviews logic and suggests improvements

**Phase 3: Polish and Extensions (30-60 minutes)**
- Add error handling and user input validation
- Implement advanced features
- Test edge cases together

## Role Guidelines

### Driver Responsibilities
- Focus on typing and immediate implementation
- Verbalise what you're thinking and doing
- Ask navigator for suggestions when stuck
- Don't just ignore navigator input

### Navigator Responsibilities
- Watch for syntax errors and typos
- Think about overall logic and flow
- Suggest alternative approaches
- Keep track of bigger picture goals
- Don't just point out errors - suggest solutions

## Communication Tips

### Effective Patterns
- "What if we tried..."
- "I notice that..."
- "Should we consider..."
- "Let me understand this part..."

### Avoid These Patterns
- Taking over the keyboard without asking
- Pointing out errors without suggesting fixes
- Working on separate problems simultaneously
- Criticising coding style without explanation

## Switching Roles

### When to Switch
- Every 20-30 minutes (set a timer)
- When driver gets stuck for more than 5 minutes
- After completing a major function or feature
- When navigator has a clear vision for next steps

### How to Switch
- Driver explains current state and next steps
- Navigator takes over and summarises the plan
- Previous driver becomes active navigator

## Dealing with Disagreements

### Technical Disagreements
- Try both approaches if time allows
- Research solutions together
- Ask staff for guidance if needed
- Document why you chose one approach

### Work Style Differences
- Agree on switching frequency upfront
- Respect different paces and thinking styles
- Take breaks if frustration builds
- Focus on learning, not just completing

## Remote Pair Programming (if continuing out of class and off-campus)

### Tools
- Screen sharing (shared IDE e.g. VS Code Live Share, Teams, Discord, Zoom etc)
- Shared repositories with frequent commits
- Voice communication for continuous discussion

### Best Practices
- Ensure good audio quality for communication
- Take more frequent breaks (every 20 minutes)
- Be more explicit about what you're thinking
- Use chat for sharing links or code snippets

## Project-Specific Tips

### Library Management System
- Start with simple book storage (lists/dictionaries)
- Get add/display working before file persistence
- Driver handles input/output, navigator reviews data flow

### Music Data Analysis
- Begin with small data subset for testing
- Split data loading vs. analysis functions
- Navigator watches for performance issues with large dataset

### Pokemon Analysis
- Start with basic search functionality
- Driver implements specific features, navigator suggests next priorities
- Good project for switching between statistical vs. game features

## Success Indicators

### You're Doing Well If:
- Both people understand the code being written
- You're catching errors quickly through discussion
- Ideas flow naturally between both people
- Code quality improves through collaborative review

### Red Flags
- One person doing all the thinking
- Long periods of silence
- Frequent miscommunication about goals
- One person consistently frustrated or disengaged

## Assessment Considerations

### Individual Accountability
- Each person should understand all code written
- Be prepared to explain any part of the solution
- Document individual contributions in comments
- Both names on final documentation with contribution notes

### Collaboration Evidence
- Commit messages showing both contributors
- Code comments explaining collaborative decisions
- Shared documentation of problem-solving approach

## Reflection Questions

After your session:
- What did you learn from your partner?
- Which role (driver/navigator) felt more natural?
- What communication patterns worked best?
- How did pair programming change your approach to the problem?
- What would you do differently next time?
