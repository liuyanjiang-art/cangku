# Your aim is to read in a text file, and calculate how many words are in it.
# You should:
#    - ask the user to enter the file name
#    - read the file in
#    - count how many words are in the file - there are multiple ways of doing this.

# You can use any of the .txt files to test this - or even make your own.

# get the file name

# open and read the file
# hint: remember to handle the case where the file might not exist

# calculate the number of words
# hint: you could use .split() to break up by spaces
# hint: watch out for empty lines that might give you empty strings

# display the wordcount

# Here are the word counts you should get:
# story.txt - 290
# story2.txt - 326
# glasses.txt - 215
