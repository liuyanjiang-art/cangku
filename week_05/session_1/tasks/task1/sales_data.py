# You've been asked to analyse a set of sales data which you can find in sales.csv

# Open the file and read the data
# find the:
#   - largest sale day (highest sale amount)
#   - average sale amount
#   - the widget which has been sold the most
# and print these out in a nice, human-readable format

# for a challenge - add a menu so the user picks which piece of data to show

# Additional hints:
# - Remember to handle file errors
# - The first row contains headers: Date, Product, Sales_Amount, Units_Sold, Region
# - Sales amounts are stored as strings - you'll need to convert to int() for math
# - For finding the highest selling widget, use a dictionary to count units sold per product
# - For average, sum all sales amounts and divide by number of rows
