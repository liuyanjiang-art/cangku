# Step 1: Prompt the user for their name, age, and favorite color.

# Step 2: Open a file called 'user_info.txt'

# Step 3: Write each piece of information to the file, each on a new line.

# hint: think about what mode to open in!
# hint: remember to add \n for new lines when writing to files
# hint: if you want multiple people to add info without overwriting, consider append mode 'a'

# you could extend this by using a loop to allow multiple people to enter their info in a row
